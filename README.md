Roadsafety

Abstract:   
                        In this developing world own transportation has become an mandatory. In other hand increase of transportation increases the road accidents rapidly. It leads to death and severe problem. Accidents are majorly caused by DRUNK&DRIVE, OVER SPEED,UNWANTED OVERTAKING.

Road accidents are majorly happed due to the above mentioned issues. Over speed can be reduced by some techniques used in recent times also drunk & drive can be avoided by checking the driver alcoholic level using sensors but due to unwanted overtaking  it canâ€™t be reduced.

Conclude:
                         In order to decrease accidents, due to unwanted overtake must be avoided by calculate the speed of opposite vehicle and calculate time need to overtake and indicate to the driver if overtaken is possible or not & due to over speed avoid by indicate drive to reduce the speed if any obstacle detected at over speed this solution are solved by interface a system in our vehicle. Its like a personal assistant for drivers. 
In our project we need create a system it automatically doing the process by the use of sensors. Speed of opposite vehicle calculate using the ultrasonic sensors from our vehicle. Then we need to calculate if overtaking is possible or not and then the system alert driver if over taking is not possible
